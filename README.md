# Intelligent Resume Scanner

Our Project is a simple resume scanner built using Streamlit as the frontend and automatic UI generation. Python as backend and a simple implementation of sqlite3 as the database. 
 
The app implements cloud technology such as streamlit cloud for ease of deployment. Along with AI technology, such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) to process the parse and process the uploaded resumes.

## Features

- Users can easily scan resumes and our application will return a brief analysis of what the resume contains, including name, contact, education background, course, skills and etc. 

- Users will be able to get tips and recommendations based on the fetch data and an overall score for the resume will also be displayed.

- Admin can monitor fetched resume data through the use of a simple table and pie charts for visualization.
